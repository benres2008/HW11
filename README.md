  ## Usage: 
  This app WOULD be used to act as an employee tracker for a company. My code would allow somebody to view all the employees in their company along with their salary, position, id, etc. and would also allow them to add employees, subtract employees, add departments, subtract depertments, etc. However, I could not cross the finish line for this assignment yet again. After hours and even days of looking over this code, I could not soleve the error that I got when trying to run the code in the terminal. I will paste the error code here: 'Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client'. I have no idea what this error means, have no more sessions left with my tutor, and have googled it to no avail. However, I am fine with partial credit on this assignment because it is pretty complicated and I still think I did a good job with the code that I ended up writing.

  ## Testing:
  To test this application, you can open the code in terminal, type "node server.js", and see what happens:)

  ## Installation:
  You must install inquirer, mysql, and console.table to be able to run this code. All of the nmps can be found online.

  ## Issues:
  You can report issues by contacting me personally at my email

  ## Link to Video (on YouTube):

  I have submitted a video of the nonfunctionall application because I feel like I can show you the issue better than I can tell you.
